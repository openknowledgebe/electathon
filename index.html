        <p>
            Did you know that the real-time data on election day May 26 was arranged to be closed and commercialised? Since this arrangement was clearly breaching the recently adopted open data law, Open Knowledge Belgium has stepped in to make sure the raw election results are freely accessible to anyone. As a matter of principle, we strive to hold government services accountable for making all their data transparent, free and publicly available in an easily decipherable format.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a pragmatic and constructive discussion with the departments and suppliers involved, Open Knowledge Belgium is pleased that the federal government has agreed to share the real-time election results in such a short term. Open Knowledge Belgium is happy to help with the distribution of the real-time files for all 6 datasets.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
          We now call on all interested parties from the open data community to help develop original applications and visualisations during an open electathon on Saturday 25 May.
